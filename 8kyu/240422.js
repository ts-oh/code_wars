Multiplication table for number

Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
P. S. You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.

// Solution

const multiTable = (number) => {
  let table = "";

  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    table += `${i} * ${number} = ${i * number}${i < 10 ? "\n" : ""}`;
  }

  return table;
};

Get Nth Even Number

Return the Nth Even Number

Example(Input --> Output)

1 --> 0 (the first even number is 0)
3 --> 4 (the 3rd even number is 4 (0, 2, 4))
100 --> 198
1298734 --> 2597466
The input will not be 0.

// Solution

function nthEven(n){
  return (n-1)*2;
}

Cat years, Dog years

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that


// Solution

const humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = (humanYears) => {
  let catYears = 0;
  let dogYears = 0;
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= humanYears; i++) {
    if (i === 1) {
      catYears += 15;
      dogYears += 15;
    }
    else if (i === 2) {
      catYears += 9;
      dogYears += 9;
    }
    else {
      catYears += 4;
      dogYears += 5;
    }
  }
  return [humanYears,catYears,dogYears];
}
