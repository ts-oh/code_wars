/*
Is the string uppercase?

Task
Add the isUpperCase method to String to see whether the string is ALL CAPS. For example:

"c".isUpperCase() == false
"C".isUpperCase() == true
"hello I AM DONALD".isUpperCase() == false
"HELLO I AM DONALD".isUpperCase() == true
"ACSKLDFJSgSKLDFJSKLDFJ".isUpperCase() == false
"ACSKLDFJSGSKLDFJSKLDFJ".isUpperCase() == true
In this Kata, a string is said to be in ALL CAPS whenever it does not contain any lowercase letter so any string containing no letters at all is trivially considered to be in ALL CAPS.

// Solution
String.prototype.isUpperCase = function () {
  if (this.toString() === this.toUpperCase()) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

/*
Student's Final Grade

Description:
Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases
Examples(Inputs-->Output):

100, 12 --> 100
99, 0 --> 100
10, 15 --> 100

85, 5 --> 90

55, 3 --> 75

55, 0 --> 0
20, 2 --> 0
*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.


// Solution
function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if(exam > 90 || projects > 10) return 100;
  if(exam > 75 & projects >= 5) return 90;
  if(exam > 50 & projects >= 2) return 75;
  return 0;
}

/*
Removing Elemnts

Description:
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:

["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

// Solutions

function removeEveryOther(arr){
  return arr.filter(function(elem, index) {
    return index % 2 === 0;
  });
}
